    <p><span class="quote">"Have you ever experienced a moment of bliss? On the rapids of inspiration maybe, your mind tracing the shapes of truth and beauty? Or in the pulsing ecstasy of love? Or in a glorious triumph achieved with true friends? Or in a conversation on a vine-overhung terrace one star-appointed night? Or perhaps a melody smuggled itself into your heart, charming it and setting it alight with kaleidoscopic emotions? Or when you prayed, and felt heard?"</span><br>- nick bostrom, utopia sci-fi letter</p>

    <p><span class="quote">"The woodpile is so beautiful, about all the joy and beauty that I can stand. I am afraid to turn around and face the mountains, for fear they will overpower me. But I did look, and I am astounded. Everyone must get to experience a profound state like this. I feel totally peaceful. I have lived all my life to get here, and I feel I have come home. I am complete."</span><br>- alexander shulgin, mdma journal</p>

    <p style="font-weight: bold;">it turns out it's possible to feel like this all the time. not just for a moment, but as our baseline.</p>

    <p style="font-weight: bold;">it turns out humans can improve baseline wellbeing by crazy orders of magnitude, by investigating and undoing particular 10-40hz tensing events which are the correlate of all suffering.</p>

    <p>but it's not super simple, and statistically takes a few thousand hours, and it's hidden by lots of terrible pedagogy and fuzzy theory and weird poems and antihelpful translation. the field is very preparadigmatic.</p>

    <p>i want to help fix that! and i love yapping about it! i think this is the most important unsolved-ish problem of our time, and it's also just my version of composing an EDM album :) i think there's almost zero resources that legibly talk about this stuff, so i'm writing one currently. hopefully it's done by the end of 2025.</p>

    <p>i've put some more introductory ramblings at [<a href="https://happymaxxing.com">happymaxxing.com</a>] and hopefully that temporarily serves as a good primer for people that wanna know more!</p>

    <p>other things:</p>
    
    <p>i believe wholesomemaxxing = happymaxxing = lovemaxxing (asymptotically, stochastically), and it seems like the hardcoded telos (purpose) and Logos (organizing principle) of life is to engage in that drama!? -- i.e. frolick around the SGD latent space towards the schelling-point-attractor-basin of love</p>

    <p>my favorite stories are kung fu panda and the jesus story. i'm also very inspired by EDM artists like dabin, and improv pianists like jon michael ogletree. my research heroes are nick cammarata and michael edward johnson.</p>
